# Mouse Event Interaction Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description
This project showcases how to handle different mouse events using JavaScript. It demonstrates interactions such as mouse clicks, double clicks, hovering, and movements. The application updates the UI in real-time based on user interactions, providing a visual understanding of mouse event handling in web applications.

## Features
- **Click Event**: Detects and responds to single mouse clicks.
- **Double Click Event**: Captures double-click actions.
- **Mouse Hover**: Changes the appearance or triggers a response when the mouse hovers over elements.
- **Mouse Move**: Tracks and displays real-time mouse movement.
- **Context Menu Event**: Detects when the user tries to open the context menu (right-click).

## Usage
- Click and Double Click: Click and double-click on elements to trigger events.
- Hover Over Elements: Move your mouse over certain elements to see hover effects.
- Mouse Move Tracking: The application tracks your mouse position as you move it across the screen.
- Right-Click: Try right-clicking on elements, and the app can detect context menu events.


## Code Structure
- HTML: Defines the elements on the page where mouse events will be captured.
- CSS: Styles the interactive elements and provides visual feedback on events.
- JavaScript: Listens for mouse events and updates the DOM accordingly.

## Customization
You can extend the functionality of the mouse events:

- Add more mouse events: Experiment with other mouse events like mousedown, mouseup, etc.
- Customize visual effects: Modify the CSS to change how elements react to events.
- Change event behavior: Update the JavaScript to change how the application handles specific mouse events.
